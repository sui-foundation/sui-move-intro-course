# Setup Development Environment

Welcome to the Sui Move introduction course. In this first unit, we will walk you through the process of setting up the development environment for working with Sui Move, and create a basic Hello World project as a gentle introduction into the world of Sui.

## Install Sui

Move is a compiled language, so you need to install a compiler to be able to write and run Move programs. The compiler is included into the Sui binary, which can be installed or downloaded using one of the methods below.

### Installing via suiup (Recommended)

The best way to install Sui is by using `suiup`. It provides a simple way to install binaries and to manage different versions of binaries for different environments (e.g. testnet and mainnet).

Installation instructions for `suiup` can be found in the [repository README](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup).

To install Sui, run the following command:

```bash
suiup install sui
```

### Download Binary

You can download the latest Sui binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases). The binary is available for macOS, Linux and Windows. For education purposes and development, we recommend using the mainnet version.

### Install Using Homebrew (macOS)

You can install Sui using the Homebrew package manager.

```bash
brew install sui
```

### Install Using Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install Sui using the Chocolatey package manager for Windows.

```bash
choco install sui
```

### Build Using Cargo (macOS, Linux)

You can install and build Sui locally by using the Cargo package manager (requires Rust)

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git sui --branch mainnet
```

Change the branch target here to `testnet` or `devnet` if you are targeting one of those.

Make sure that your system has the latest Rust versions with the command below.

```bash
rustup update stable
```

### Verify Installation

Check binaries are installed successfully:

```bash
sui --version
```

You should see the version number in the terminal if sui binaries were installed successfully.

### Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting the installation process, please refer to the [Install Sui Guide](https://docs.sui.io/build/install).

## Using a Docker Image with Pre-installed Sui Binaries

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Pull Sui official docker image

   `docker pull mysten/sui-tools:devnet`

3. Start and shell into the Docker container:

   `docker run --name suidevcontainer -itd mysten/sui-tools:devnet`

   `docker exec -it suidevcontainer bash`

_ðŸ’¡Note: If the above Docker image is not compatible with your CPU architecture, you can start with a base [Rust](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) Docker image appropriate for your CPU architecture, and install the Sui binaries and prerequisites as described above.\_

## (Optional) Configure VS Code with Move Analyzer Plug-in

1. Install [Move Analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer) from VS Marketplace

2. Add compatibility for Sui style wallet addresses:

   `cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --features "address20"`

## Sui CLI Basic Usage

[Reference Page](https://docs.sui.io/build/cli-client)

### Initialization

- Enter `Y` for `do you want to connect to a Sui Full node server?` and press `Enter` to default to Sui Devnet full node
- Enter `0` for key scheme selection to choose [`ed25519`](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)

### Managing Networks

- Switching network: `sui client switch --env [network alias]`
- Default network aliases:
  - localnet: http://0.0.0.0:9000
  - devnet: https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
- List all current network aliases: `sui client envs`
- Add new network alias: `sui client new-env --alias <ALIAS> --rpc <RPC>`
  - Try adding a testnet alias with: `sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`

### Check Active Address and Gas Objects

- Check current addresses in key store: `sui client addresses`
- Check active-address: `sui client active-address`
- List all controlled gas objects: `sui client gas`

## Get Devnet or Testnet Sui Tokens

1. [Join Sui Discord](https://discord.gg/sui)
2. Complete verification steps
3. Enter [`#devnet-faucet`](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) channel for devnet tokens, or [`#testnet-faucet`](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) channel for testnet tokens
4. Type `!faucet <WALLET ADDRESS>`
