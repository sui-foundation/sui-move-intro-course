# Clock and Locked Coin Example

In the second fungible token example, we will introduce how to obtain time on-chain in Sui, and how to utilize that to implement a vesting mechanism for a coin.

## Clock

Sui Framework has a native [clock module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui/clock.md) that makes timestamps available in Move smart contracts.

The main method that you will need to access is the following:

```
public fun timestamp_ms(clock: &clock::Clock): u64
```

the [`timestamp_ms`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui/clock.md#function-timestamp_ms) function returns the current system timestamp, as a running total of milliseconds since an arbitrary point in the past.

The [`clock`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui/clock.md#sui_clock_Clock) object has a special reserved identifier, `0x6`, that needs to be passed into function calls using it as one of the inputs.

## Locked Coin

Now that we know how to access time on-chain through `clock`, implementing a vesting fungible token is relatively straight forward.

### `Locker` Custom Type

`locked_coin` builds on top of the `managed_coin` implementation with the addition of one more custom type, `Locker`:

```move
/// Transferrable object for storing the vesting coins
public struct Locker has key, store {
    id: UID,
    start_date: u64,
    final_date: u64,
    original_balance: u64,
    current_balance: Balance<LOCKED_COIN>

}
```

Locker is a transferrable [asset](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/main/unit-one/lessons/3_custom_types_and_abilities.md#assets) that encodes the information related to the vesting schedule and vesting status of tokens issued.

`start_date` and `final_date` are timestamps obtained from `clock`, marking the start and end of the vesting term.

`original_balance` is the initial balance issued into a `Locker`, `balance` is the current and remaining balance taking account any vested portion that's already withdrawn.

### Minting

In the `locked_mint` method, we create and transfer a `Locker` with the specified amount of tokens and vesting scheduled encoded:

```move
/// Mints and transfers a locker object with the input amount of coins and
/// specified vesting schedule
public fun locked_mint(
    treasury_cap: &mut TreasuryCap<LOCKED_COIN>,
    recipient: address,
    amount: u64,
    lock_up_duration: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let coin = treasury_cap.mint(amount, ctx);
    let start_date = clock.timestamp_ms();
    let final_date = start_date + lock_up_duration;

    transfer::public_transfer(
        Locker {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            start_date,
            final_date,
            original_balance: amount,
            current_balance: coin.into_balance(),
        },
        recipient,
    );
}
```

Note how `clock` is used here to get the current timestamp.

### Withdrawing

The `withdraw_vested` method contains the majority of the logic to compute the vested amounts:

```move
/// Withdraw the available vested amount assuming linear vesting
public fun withdraw_vested(
    locker: &mut Locker,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let total_duration = locker.final_date - locker.start_date;
    let elapsed_duration = clock.timestamp_ms() - locker.start_date;
    let total_vested_amount = if (elapsed_duration > total_duration) {
        locker.original_balance
    } else {
        locker.original_balance * elapsed_duration / total_duration
    };
    let available_vested_amount =
        total_vested_amount - (locker.original_balance - locker.current_balance.value());
    transfer::public_transfer(
        coin::take(&mut locker.current_balance, available_vested_amount, ctx),
        ctx.sender(),
    )
}
```

This example assumes a simple linear vesting schedule, but can be modified to accommodate a wide range of vesting logic and schedule.
