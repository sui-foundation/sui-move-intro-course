# Intro to Generics

Generics are abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties. They work similarly to [generics in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch10-00-generics.html), and can be used to allow greater flexibility and avoid logic duplication while writing Sui Move code.

Generics are a key concept in Sui Move, and it's important to understand and have an intuition for how they work, so take your time with this section and understand every part fully. 

## Generics Usage

### Using Generics in Structs

Let's look at a basic example of how to use generics to create a container `Box` that can hold any type in Sui Move.

First, without generics, we can define a `Box` that holds a `u64` type as the following:

```move
module  generics::storage;

public struct Box {
    value: u64
}

```

However, this type will only be able to hold a value of type `u64`. To make our `Box` able to hold any generic type, we will need to use generics. The code would be modified as follows:

```move
module  generics::storage;
public struct Box<T> {
    value: T
}
```

#### Ability Constraints

We can add conditions to enforce that the type passed into the generic must have certain abilities. The syntax looks like the following:

```move
module  generics::storage;
// T must be copyable and droppable 
public struct Box<T: store + drop> has key, store {
    value: T
}

```

ðŸ’¡It's important to note here that the inner type `T` in the above example must meet certain ability constraints due to the outer container type. In this example, `T` must have `store`, as `Box` has `store` and `key`. However, `T` can also have abilities that the container doesn't have, such as `drop` in this example.

The intuition is that if the container is allowed to contain a type that does not follow the same rules that it does, the container would violate its own ability. How can a box be storable if its content isn't also storable?

We will see in the next section that there is a way to get around this rule in certain cases using a special keyword, called `phantom`. 

*ðŸ’¡See the [generics project](../example_projects/generics/) under `example_projects` for some examples of generic types.*

### Using Generics in Functions

To write a function that returns an instance of `Box` that can accept a parameter of any type for the `value` field, we also have to use generics in the function definition. The function can be defined as the following:

```move
public fun create_box<T>(value: T): Box<T> {
        Box<T> { value }
    }
```

If we want to restrict the function to only accept a specific type for `value`, we simply specify that type in the function signature as follows:

```move
public fun create_box(value: u64): Box<u64> {
        Box<u64>{ value }
    }
```

This will only accept inputs of the type `u64` for the `create_box` method, while still using the same generic `Box` struct. 

#### Calling Functions with Generics

To call a function with a signature that contains generics, we must specify the type in angle brackets, as in the following syntax:

```move
// value will be of type storage::Box<bool>
    let bool_box = storage::create_box<bool>(true);
// value will be of the type storage::Box<u64>
    let u64_box = storage::create_box<u64>(1000000);
```

#### Calling Functions with Generics using Sui CLI

To call a function with generics in its signature from the Sui CLI, you must define the argument's type using the flag `--type-args`.

The following is an example that calls the `create_box` function to create a box that contains a coin of the type `0x2::sui::SUI`:

```bash
sui client call --package $PACKAGE --module $MODULE --function "create_box" --args $OBJECT_ID --type-args 0x2::sui::SUI
```

## Advanced Generics Syntax

For more advanced syntax involving the use of generics in Sui Move, such as multiple generic types, please refer to the excellent [section on generics in the Move Book](https://move-book.com/advanced-topics/understanding-generics.html). 

But for our current lesson on fungible tokens, you already know enough about how generics work to proceed.
